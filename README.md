Paper Title:
Improving Wind Turbine Gearbox Reliability: A Hybrid Deep Learning Approach Using Bispectrum Image Analysis

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10935342?source=authoralert
doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3553122


Key points:
Problem: Wind turbine gearboxes experience fluctuating wind speeds and loads, causing noise and complexity in vibration signals, complicating fault diagnosis.

Objective: Explore bispectrum image analysis combined with CNN, CNN-LSTM, and CNN-BiLSTM for fault detection and predictive maintenance in wind turbine systems.

Method: Bispectrum images identify nonlinearities, harmonics, and interactions between frequency components to improve fault diagnosis.

Results: All models achieved high accuracy (98%), with CNN-BiLSTM showing the best performance.

Key Finding: CNN-BiLSTM demonstrates superior classification accuracy, better generalization, and minimal misclassification due to its ability to capture bidirectional temporal patterns.

Conclusion: Bi-spectrum analysis is effective for detecting abnormalities, enabling timely maintenance and preventing catastrophic failures in wind turbine systems.
